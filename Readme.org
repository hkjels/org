#+TITLE: Suite of org-mode tools
:END:

I've been using ~org-mode~ a fair amount lately and think I'll convert some of
my prior work into org-files. To that end, I'm creating a few tools to ease the
development of org-files.

For now, there's only the command ~org untangle~. All it does is take a bunch of
files as input and it outputs org-mode with tangling-headers.

Here you see how you could assemble an org-file from this very repository and
output that to ~org.org~.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
org untangle "$(find bin) Makefile" > org.org
#+END_SRC
